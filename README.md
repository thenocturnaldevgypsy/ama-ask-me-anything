## ![SECTION About this Repository](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-About%20this%20Repository-24292e?logo=repo&logoColor=white&labelColor=00416a)

Ask [@thenocturnaldevgypsy](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy) about...anything you want, in [my AMA repo](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/ama-ask-me-anything).



## ![SECTION Ask a question](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-Ask%20a%20question-24292e?logo=megaphone&logoColor=white&labelColor=00416a)

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/ama-ask-me-anything/issues/new) on this repo.

I'm happy to answer any questions that are professional or personal in nature as long as they are in good taste. I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry - if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

You should be aware that this is a public repository, so the content you post here will be visible to the public. 

Sometimes I might not have a good answer for your question, but I'll do my best to give you a good answer if I have one!

## ![SECTION Read old questions](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-Read%20old%20questions-24292e?logo=comment-discussion&logoColor=white&labelColor=00416a)

Check out the [closed Issues](https://github.com/thenocturnaldevgypsy/ama-ask-me-anything/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1) filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.
